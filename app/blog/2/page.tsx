              <p className="text-gray-300">
                If you've been around lory.dev lately, you might have noticed that the website changed quite a bit.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                Mainly, the whole website layout has been redone, with Next.js instead of just basic HTML, CSS and JS.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                If you'd like, the old website is still available at legacy.lory.dev, and will be for an indefinite amount of time.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">What about Lory3D?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-300">You might have also noticed that, out of the blog posts that have been ported to the new website, one is missing.</p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">I've stopped working on Lory3D lately, simply because I do not need it. It was just a way for me to work with Java, and I do not wanna work with Java ever again.</p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">It's very very buggy at the moment, and I simply do not wanna work on it, because it stops me from working on things like this website.</p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">All of a sudden?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                I preferred keeping this, as well as many other projects, private until I have something to show. The new lory.dev is still in development!
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">Before you ask, yes, the new website is open source. You can check it out on GitHub.</p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">Bye</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-300">That's too much writing for me, especially after writing the whole website. I will see you in the next one.</p>
